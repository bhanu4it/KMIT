 About ECE</h6  >

 <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:90%;font-family:verdana;">
 The present intake at B Tech is 0 (Discontinued fresh admissions from 2020-21).It is one of the most significant branches of engineering which has always been in demand. Our department is known for its efficiency and holds a strong reputation. The department aims primarily at excellence not only in theoretical but also in Experimental Research in Microwaves, Antennas, VLSI, Signal Processing, Communications, Embedded Systems etc. This department has well qualified and proficient faculty members with a wide range of experience in academics and industry as well.ECE finishing school in KMIT, bridges the gap between industry and academia. Specialized trainings are imparted to the students based on the requirement of the Industry.The department has registered with the professional bodies like IETE ,IEEE , ISTE memberships which help our students to get the perspective of the electronics world.
