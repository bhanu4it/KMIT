 About CSE
 </h6  >

 <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:90%;font-family:verdana;">
 The Department of Computer Science and Engineering was established in 2007
with an intake of 60 for Under Graduate Program and enhanced to 300 in 2012 and
then to 420 in 2014.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;font-size:90%;font-family:verdana;">
CSE department has obtained AICTE permission to start two new undergraduate
courses - Computer Science &amp; Engineering                
(Artificial Intelligence(AI&amp;ML)) and Computer Science &amp;
Engineering (Data Science (DS)) from the academic year (2020-21).
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;font-size:90%;font-family:verdana;">
Department is equipped with dedicated and experienced faculty who continuously
upgrade their skills under the guidance of the founder Director Neil Gogte, who is
one of the stalwarts in Computer Science &amp; Engineering. The department highly
encourages Industry Institute Interaction to bridge the gap between Industry and
the Institute by fulfilling their expectations in conduction of various workshops for
students on latest emerging trends and technologies, which makes the students to
explore and undertake challenging tasks confidently.
The department has collaboration with reputed Organizations to explore, build,
develop and enhance technical skills in trending technologies among faculty and
students.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;font-size:90%;font-family:verdana;">
Every year most of the students of CSE Department are placed through campus
recruitments in top most software companies like Amazon, Microsoft, SAP Labs,
Adobe, Salesforce, Google, Darwin Box, Virtusa, and other reputed organizations.
The department has required number of fully equipped and furnished computer
labs which facilitates the students to have their active participation and
concentration. The department has CSI Institutional Membership for with students
&amp; faculty as members.&nbsp;The CSI student Chapter regularly organizes various
technical events and workshops in current technologies for the enhancement of
student knowledge. The department is also aiming to introduce Masters and
Doctoral research programs.
