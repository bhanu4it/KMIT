  Having started in 2007, KMIT's first batch graduated in the year 2011. With the sole objective of producing industry ready engineering students. KMIT has instituted a comprehensive Finishing School program for its Final year students. We believe that this program will go a long way in bridging the industry-academia gap that all of us are so well aware of. The Finishing School is run concurrently with the B.Tech course, unlike other Finishing schools which are offered after the completion of B.Tech.</p>
  <h5  class="blue-clr bold">The modality of conducting the Finishing School is as follows:</h5>

They will automatically receive an email with status report of the student performance every week.</li></ol><h5  class="blue-clr bold">Engagement Model</h5><ol  class="enganement-model-list"><li >The Finishing School representative will meet the recruiting company and give them the user name to enable access to the recruiter zone.</li><li >The Recruiting company will identify and shortlist the pool of students.</li><li >The recruiting companies shall identify the modules for the 2nd semester of the Finishing School to be taken by the identified students.</li><li >The progress of the students will be tracked continuously.</li><li >The recruiting company visits the campus and the recruitment process is held.</li><li >Successful students are given offer letters by the recruiting company.</li>
