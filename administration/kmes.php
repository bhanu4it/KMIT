It is well known in Hyderabad, for the past 75 years for running various educational institutes of repute. KMES celebrated its platinum jubilee year in 2014-15. This society was formed in the sacred memory of Justice Keshav Rao Koratkar, an eminent educationist, social reformer and political activist. He was a close associate of Bala Gangadhar Tilak and took active role in the freedom struggle of India. After he passed away, his son Pandit Vinayak Rao Vidyalanka, who was a Minister in the Burgula Ramakrishna Rao’s cabinet and Member of Parliament, started a middle school in his father’s memory. It started with 10-15 students and now has many educational institutions and many eminent people as the alumni of the institutions.</p>
