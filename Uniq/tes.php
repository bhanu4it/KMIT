  Tessellator is KMIT’s learning management system. It is customized version of 
  <strong _ngcontent-c6="">Moodle</strong>, an open source learning management system 
  provided by Google. We at KMIT have customized it as per our needs and have been using 
  it on multiple networks. It provides an option of 2 different modules. 
  After each programming class, students are required to take a quiz which is a 
  collection of multiple choice questions. Once they submit the quiz, 
  they are presented with a form where they have guidelines to write 
  code( program Eg: JAVA, C) pertaining to the class held. 
  There are usually three programs given to the students as a part of the test. 
  If the student is a slow learner, he/ she might be able to work on a single program. 
  The fast learners may go to the 3rd program. Google’s platform Moodle by itself doesn’t 
  have the code compilation technique but we at KMIT have extended its capabilities to 
  suffice our needs and have added code compilation techniques for JAVA, C and few other 
  programming languages. </p></div>
